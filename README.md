# Student Success and Dropout Prediction using Machine Learning

This machine learning project focuses on predicting student enrollment outcomes using five classification algorithms: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor, and Logistic Regression. The dataset contains student demographic information, educational background, admission grades, and academic performance in the first and second semesters. The goal is to classify students into three categories: "Dropout," "Enrolled," and "Graduate."

The project compares the performance of the algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the most effective model.

The results of this project provide valuable insights into factors influencing student success or dropout rates. Educational institutions can use these findings to implement targeted interventions and support systems, ultimately improving student retention and success.

## Using GridSearchCV
GridSearchCV automates the process of trying out different combinations of hyperparameter values and evaluating how well the model performs with each combination. It does this by dividing the data into smaller parts and training the model on different combinations of these parts. This helps us understand how well the model would perform on unseen data.

The benefit of using GridSearchCV is that it saves time and effort by automatically exploring different hyperparameter combinations. It helps us find the best settings for our model without having to try them all manually.
